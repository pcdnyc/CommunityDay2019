<h2><a href="https://www.emotibit.com/" alt="Sean Montgomery">Sean Montgomery</a></h2>
<p>I'm the founder of Connected Future Labs, a New York City-based R&D engineering company that specializes in bringing technology out of the lab and into the real world. From machine learning to computer vision, to circuits that sense the body, our work aims to deliver real-world impact from cutting edge research.

Since finishing my Ph.D. in Neuroscience, I've lead teams developing a number of products in wearable technology and affective computing. I'm currently the Head of R&D at the wearable AI company, SUPA, previously Head of Hardware at Ringly, and have several patents pending for wearable and non-wearable products utilizing embedded biosensors combined with machine learning algorithms to detect changing physical and psychophysiological states.

I periodically teach courses and workshops at MIT, NYU, and Hunter College and regularly show interactive installation artwork around the world that interrogates the human condition and our changing relationship to the physical and metaphysical world.

<img class="profile-photo" src="/images/2020_presenters/francisco_rojo.jpg">
<h2><a href="https://fran.red">Francisco Rojo</a></h2>
<p>I recently moved to Brooklyn from Pittsburgh, PA. I am an artist that makes interactive experiences, environments, and narratives that are grounded in my lived experience. My work celebrates the detail and aesthetics of everyday existence by creating spaces to explore and play that enkindle an appreciation for our shared reality. I create spaces within virtual and physical contexts.

I've made a few small videogames (https://frojo.itch.io) inspired by personal experiences. Among the tools I used to make these games are Unity, Godot, and PICO-8. I was part of the School for Poetic Computation's Fall 2019 cohort, and for the final showcase I created an interactive piece that was an experiment in vulnerability: a closet in the exhibition space was turned into a cozy, alternate space. Participants were let in one a time and were invited to write down a secret on a piece of paper before leaving, leaving a room full of secrets.

After graduating in 2016 with a degree in computer engineering and operating systems, I worked at Google as a Software Engineer until 2019. I worked on Chrome OS, improving frame-rate for a tablet device, and on Google Shopping, where I optimized software infrastructure that processed petabytes of data daily.</p>

<h2><a href="http://spacefiller.space">Alexander Miller</a></h2>
<p>I’m an artist, educator and programmer from Seattle, WA. As part of the artist group SPACEFILLER, I create interactive algorithmic playgrounds through computation, light, sound and sculpture. Our work has been featured by the Seattle Times, The Stranger magazine, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the Seattle Symphony, and the Seattle Art Museum. I’m also currently involved with teaching and organization at the School for Poetic Computation.

I’m interested in systems that exhibit spontaneous emergence of order and structure (for example: crystal growth, bird flocking, human consciousness). These are local pockets of structure that resist the global tide of entropy, and they inspire my creation of algorithmically simulated models of natural systems.</p>
