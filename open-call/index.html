			<h3>Talk</h3>
			<p>Talk about your work, a concept, research, a project or other endeavor related to the themes of the Processing community. Your talk should be 30 minutes to an hour, including a Q & A with the audience.</p>

			<h3>Workshop</h3>
			<p>We are looking for a variety of workshops, including non-coding and hands-on sessions. Workshops should be 45 minutes to an hour. Workshops can be open to a broad community, beginner focused, or on an advanced topic.</p>

			<h3>Panel or Facilitated Conversation</h3>
