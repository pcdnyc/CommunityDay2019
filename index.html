			<h2>What is Processing Community Day?</h2>
			<p>Processing Community Day is a non-profit, community conference, consisting of activists, artists, designers, teachers, programmers and students.</p>
			<p>Processing Community Day is a day to celebrate art, code, and diversity. A focus of this project is to make learning how to program and make creative work with code accessible to diverse communities, especially those who might not otherwise
				have access
				to these tools and resources. We are one of hundreds of sites around the world holding a local Processing Community Day event in 2019. </p>

			<h2>Who is part of the Processing community?</h2>
			<p>You are‚ÄºÔ∏è Together, we are a community of activists, artists, designers, teachers, programmers and students. We are interested in reintegrating computer literacy and coding practices in all aspects and levels of education. We believe in the
				power
				of digital creative tools and the importance of open source community. We are gathering in real life in order to bolster community relationships and with the hopes of attracting new members to the Processing community üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶. We are
				particularly interested
				in reaching out both to individuals who are new to or have never programmed before as well as longtime fans of Processing.</p>

			<p> Technology üíª can at times be faceless and intimidating. We plan to meet and interact IRL to show the people behind the usernames / laptops/ screens and the processes behind creative code and open source creative communities. With the
				advance
				of the p5.js framework - we are interested in talking about networked technologies in creative or interdisciplinary contexts. From primary school through post-secondary education and beyond we are all students üë©‚Äçüíª and we are all teachers. We
				believe
				in the emancipatory possibility of digital literacy and are passionate about creating tools and methodologies that meet our networked world üåç.

			<h2>What is Processing?</h2>
			<p>Processing is a free and open-source software platform for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts, created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry. It is complemented by a web implementation called p5.js, Processing.py in Python,
				Processing for Android, and Processing for Pi. These implementations are maintained by <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/" target="_blank"> The Processing Foundation</a> and used by a worldwide community of artists, coders, educators,
				and students.
