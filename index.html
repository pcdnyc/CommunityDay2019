				<p>Processing Community Day is a non-profit, community conference, consisting of activists, artists, designers, teachers, programmers and students.</p>

				<!--<h2>About</h2>
				<section>
					<h3>What is Processing Community Day?</h3>
					<p>We are a community of activists, artists, designers, teachers, programmers and students. We are interested in
						reintegrating computer literacy and coding practices in all aspects and levels of education. We believe in the power
						of digital creative tools
						and the importance of open source community. We are gathering in real life in order to bolster community relationships
						and with the hopes of attracting new members to the Processing community. We are particularly interested in reaching
						out to individuals
						who are new to or have never programmed before. Individuals in the humanities who are curious about technology.
						Technology can at times be faceless and intimidating; we are hoping to meet and interact IRL to show the people behind
						the usernames /
						laptops/ screens. And the processes behind creative code and open source creative communities. With the advance of the
						p5.js framework - we are interested in talking about networked technologies in creative or interdisciplinary contexts.
						From primary
						school all the way thru post-secondary education. We are all students and we are all teachers. We believe in the
						emancipatory possibility of digital literacy and are passionate about creating tools and methodologies that meet our
						networked world.

					<h3>What is Processing?</h3>
					<p>
						Processing is a free and open-source software platform for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts,
						created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry. It is complemented by a web version, called p5.js, created by Lauren McCarthy. To
						date <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/" target="_blank"> the Processing Foundation</a>, maintain Processing
						and p5.js, which are used by a worldwide community of artists, coders, educators, students.
