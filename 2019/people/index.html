<h2>Layla	Quinones</h2>
<p>Hello processing community! I am a Computer Science teacher at The Laboratory School for Finance and Technology in the South Bronx. I serve students located in the most challenged congressional district in the country, but also who are incredibly passionate about Computer Science. I received my BS and MA from New York University in Physics Education, and have since focused on teaching CS and spreading CS Education to both teachers and students all over NYC. I am particularly passionate about integrating CS across the curriculum, identifying entry points for CS in other subjects, and providing tools for highly effective teaching.</p>

<h2><a href="www.matthewortega.studio" alt="Matthew Ortega Studio">Matthew	Ortega</a></h2>
<p>Matthew Ortega is an artist, designer and musician working at the intersection of art and technology. He attended Mason Gross School of the Arts in the 2000s, where remix culture and questions of authorship reemerged as a result of new technologies. He was drawn to the excitement about the use of internet detritus and blatant disregard of copyright in new works of art. He primarily began to use collage and digital media to take part in this open source sense of culture. Beyond the use of traditional media such as cut and torn paper, he also worked with video and sound by using archival film and youtube clips to create fictional narratives. After a brief hiatus working as a digital designer, he acquired the skills to start creating custom software to further expand his artistic expression. Though he still works with ideas of refuse, decay, and distortion that come from remix culture, he also began to explore what technology can offer to one’s art practice.</p>
