<h2>Layla	Quinones</h2>
<h3>Processing and Sound for Urban Students</h3>
<p>Hello processing community! I am a Computer Science teacher at The Laboratory School for Finance and Technology in the South Bronx. I serve students located in the most challenged congressional district in the country, but also who are incredibly passionate about Computer Science. I received my BS and MA from New York University in Physics Education, and have since focused on teaching CS and spreading CS Education to both teachers and students all over NYC. I am particularly passionate about integrating CS across the curriculum, identifying entry points for CS in other subjects, and providing tools for highly effective teaching.</p>

<h3>Designing Brushes in Processing</h3>
<p>Matthew Ortega is an artist, designer and musician working at the intersection of art and technology. He attended Mason Gross School of the Arts in the 2000s, where remix culture and questions of authorship emerged as a result of new technologies. He primarily began to use collage and digital media to take part in this open source sense of culture. After working as a digital designer for many years, he learned how to program and started creating custom software to expand his artistic expression. He now focuses on concepts around speed, consciousness, and extending traditional tools in his studio practice. He also runs the computational design studio Form &amp; Void.</p>

<h2>Bozana Predojevic</h2>
<h3>Grandmother Who Codes</h3>
<p>I am an international student from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since I was a child I have been interested in human beings, and later on in their behavior. I studied at University of Banja Luka's Dentistry program and trained in Cardiology, Infectious Diseases, Pathology and Pediatrics in the Clinic “Paprikovac”. There I gained knowledge about the physical complexity of a human being but I was not satisfied and decided to explore further. I came to America and am currently attending Purchase College to pursue a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Psychology, and I love it. My Senior Project, a special research project at Purchase, blends Computer Science, Mathematics and Psychology on the topic “Mathematics and Computer Science Phobias”. This topic is very important in order to understand how we may help others realize that Mathematics and Computer Science can be fun to learn instead of their more typical perception as boring and difficult subjects.</p>

<h3>Code + Liberal Arts</h3>
<p> As a practicing mathematician in a Liberal Arts College, I am interested in a broad range of mathematics. My research is focused on mathematics applied to the social sciences, particularly game theory, fair division, voting and allocation problems. I am also interested in the visual tools and metaphors used to convey mathematical meaning and am a member of the Parsons’ based Visualizing Finance Lab which looks at the intersection of narrative visualization, financial literacy and behavioral economics.</p>
